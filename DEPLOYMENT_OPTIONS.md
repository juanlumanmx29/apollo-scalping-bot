# Apollo Scalping Bot - Deployment Options

## Current Issue
Railway is caching deployment configuration and ignoring our repository changes. 
Still running: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`

## Solution 1: Fix Railway (Recommended)
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. **Delete current deployment completely**
3. **Redeploy from GitHub** (fresh deployment)
4. Ensure Railway uses our new `main.py` file

## Solution 2: Deploy to Render
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Use the `render.yaml` configuration file
4. Deploy as web service

## Solution 3: Deploy to Heroku
1. Install Heroku CLI
2. Create Heroku app
3. Deploy using git push

## Solution 4: Deploy to Google Cloud Run
1. Build Docker container

3. Use existing Dockerfile in backend/

## Current Repository State
- ✅ Fixed PORT environment variable handling in Python

## Next Steps
**You need to manually reset Railway deployment or switch to alternative platform.**
